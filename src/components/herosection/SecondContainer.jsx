              Important Note:If you have very thin hair, be cautious with the
              heat settings during the ironing process. Thin hair may not
              withstand high temperatures, which are necessary for effective
              straightening. For effective results, follow our instructions
              carefully and opt for aftercare treatments for prolonged results.
